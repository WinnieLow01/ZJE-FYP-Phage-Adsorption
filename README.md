# Final Year Project: Computational Modelling of Bacteriophage Adsorption

Supervisors: Dr. Sebastian Leptihn; Dr. Melanie Stefan

## Description
Bacteriophage (phage) adsorption plays a key role in initiating infection. It is a process that involves complex interactions between phage receptor binding proteins (RBPs) and host surface receptors. Elucidating the mechanistic details of phage-host interaction is crucial to promote phage-related applications in medical settings. In this study, we developed two types of computational models of phage adsorption that considers spatial effects. We aim to use these models to study phage behaviour during phage-host interaction.
